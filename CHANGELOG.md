### 0.5.17 (2015-01-23)

- Fixed: The hints generation no longer crashes on some pages (regression since
  version 0.5.15).

### 0.5.16 (2015-01-22)

- Fixed: The toolbar button no longer throws errors. (This fix should have been
  in 0.5.15 but was forgotten. Luckily an AMO reviewer found it.)

### 0.5.15 (2015-01-21)

- Improved: This version is now forwards-compatible with the upcoming version
  0.6.0. Downgrading from 0.6.0 to 0.5.14 or older might cause VimFx to crash,
  but downgrading from 0.6.0 to 0.5.15 is safe.
- Fixed: Non-hintchars key presses in hints mode are now suppressed. They used
  to be passed along to the browser, which could confusingly activate site
  commands.
- Fixed: The 'f' command now always opens links in the same tab. Links used to
  be able to force a new tab or window.
- Fixed: Pressing 'Esc' in the location bar now restores the URL, as is the
  default behaviour of Firefox. You may now also close Firefox dialogs using
  'Esc'.
- Improved: Updated the de locale. Thanks to Alexander Haeussler!
- Improved: Updated the pl locale. Thanks to morethanoneanimal!

### 0.5.14 (2014-08-16)

- Fixed: Locales should now work properly.
- Improved: Updated the zh-CN locale (@mozillazg).
- Improved: Updated the de locale (@Kambfhase).
- Added: Japanese locale (@pluser).
- Fixed: If you switched to another tab or window while an `<input>` element
  was focused and then switched back, the `<input>` element got blurred, while
  it should have stayed focused. This caused the auto-type feature of KeePassX
  to break.

### 0.5.13 (2014-08-02)

- Fixed: The vote button on StackExchange sites are now markable again.
- Improved: Detection of previous/next links. Should work better on gmail now.
- Fixed: It is now possible to use Enter/Return in keyboard shortcuts.
- Improved: The n/N commands (etc.) now work even if you didnâ€™t open the finbar
  using the VimFx command (such as the default key binding ctrl+f, or by
  clicking a menu item).
- Improved: It is now possible to blur text inputs without sending Esc to the
  page, which could cause dialogs etc. to annoyingly close.
- Improved: Updated the el-GR locale (@sirodoht).
- Fixed: Autofocus prevention sometimes made text inputs impossible to focus
  until you reloaded the page.
- Improved: Autofocus prevention now works on more sites than before.
- Improved: Autofocus prevention now prevents _all_ automatic focusing (not
  just when the page loads). This makes devdocs.io much easier to use.
- Added: When viewing images directly and the image has been resized to fit the
  screen the image is now markable, allowing you to toggle zoom on it using the
  keyboard.
- Fixed: It is no longer possible to add conflicting shortcuts (such as adding
  'a' when 'af' and 'as' are already present).

### 0.5.12 (2014-06-01)
