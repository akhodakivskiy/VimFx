      # grows. That does _not_ cause new 'overflow' events. This way, the root
      # element actually becomes scrollable, but we don’t get to know about it,
      # making the root element impossible to scroll if there are other
      # scrollable elements on the page. Therefore, always re-check the root
      # element when adding new scrollable elements. This could in theory happen

  # In theory, this method could return `@largest`. In reality, it is not that
  # simple. Elements may overflow when zooming in or out, but the
  # `.scrollHeight` of the element is not correctly updated when the 'overflow'
  # event occurs, making it possible for unscrollable elements to slip in. So
  # this method has to check whether the largest element really is scrollable,
  # and update it if needed. In the case where there is no largest element
  # (left), it _should_ mean that the page hasn’t got any scrollable elements,
  # and the whole page itself isn’t scrollable. However, we cannot be 100% sure
  # that nothing is scrollable (for example, if VimFx is updated in the middle
  # of a session). So in that case, instead of simply returning `null`, return
  # the entire page (the best bet). Not being able to scroll is very annoying.
