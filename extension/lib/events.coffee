    # doesn’t like any automatic focusing, right? This is actually useful on

    # before an autofocus, causing it not to be blurred, but that’s not likely.
    # Lastly, the autofocus prevention is restricted to `<input>` elements,
    # since only such elements are commonly autofocused.  Many sites have
