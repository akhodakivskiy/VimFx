# VimFx - Vim keyboard shortcuts for Firefox

*Extension AMO page*: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimfx/

*Contribute your localization! See `locale` folder*

[VimFx](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimfx/) 
is a [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop) 
extension which introduces Vim-style keyboard shortcuts for browsing and navigation, 
significantly reducing the use of mouse, and allowing your hands to rest on the home row.

VimFx was inspired by [Vimperator](http://www.vimperator.org/) 
and designed after [Vimium](http://vimium.github.com/) for 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) preserving the shortcuts and behavior.
If your are used to Vimium then it will be easy to get started with VimFx.

## Why VimFx was created

Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox.  In my opinion the problem 
with Vimperator is that it has too many features and aggressively changes 
the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium was developed for Google Chrome
and it was exactly what I needed in terms of added functionality. That's why I decided 
to develop similar extension for Firefox.

VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.
