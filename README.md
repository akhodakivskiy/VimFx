## Overview

[VimFx] is a [Mozilla Firefox] extension which adds Vim-style keyboard shortcuts
for browsing and navigation, significantly reducing the use of the mouse, and
allowing your hands to rest on the home row.

VimFx was inspired by [Vimperator] and designed after [Vimium] for [Google
Chrome] preserving the shortcuts and behavior. If you are used to Vimium then
it will be easy to get started with VimFx.

## Why VimFx was created

Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion the problem
with Vimperator is that it has too many features and aggressively changes the
default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium was developed for Google Chrome
and it was exactly what I needed in terms of added functionality. That's why I
decided to develop similar extension for Firefox.

VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.

## Key Features

- Concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions.
- Follow links, focus text inputs and click buttons on the page using hint
  markers.
- Easily accessible help dialog for the keyboard shortcuts.
- Every keyboard shortcut is customizable.
- Prefers native Firefox features over re-implementing similar functionality.

## Shortcuts

This is a text representation of the keyboard shortcuts dialog within the
extension, which helps you remember the shortcuts, and lets you customize them.
Press <kbd>?</kbd> or use the toolbar button to open it.
