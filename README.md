# VimFx – Vim keyboard shortcuts for Firefox

<img src="extension/skin/icon128.png" alt="" align="right">

[VimFx] is a [Mozilla Firefox] extension which adds Vim-style keyboard shortcuts
for browsing and navigation, significantly reducing the use of the mouse, and
allowing your hands to rest on the home row.

VimFx was inspired by [Vimperator] and designed after [Vimium] for [Google
Chrome], preserving the shortcuts and behavior. If you are used to Vimium then
it will be easy to get started with VimFx.

## Why VimFx was created

> Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion the problem
> with Vimperator is that it has too many features and aggressively changes the
> default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium was developed for Google Chrome
> and it was exactly what I needed in terms of added functionality. That's why I
> decided to develop similar extension for Firefox.
>
> VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.

## Key Features

VimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply
invoke native Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar
functionality.

Follow links, focus text inputs and click buttons using hint markers by pressing
<kbd>f</kbd>. This command has many variations to for example copy links and
open links in new tabs.

Search with <kbd>/</kbd> and cycle between matches with <kbd>n</kbd> and
<kbd>N</kbd>.

Open a new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>, close it with <kbd>x</kbd>. Reopen it again
with <kbd>X</kbd>. There are many more tab related commands, for example to
change the currently selected tab.

Scrolling left/down/up/right: <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>.  
Top/Bottom: <kbd>gg</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd>.  
Page up/down: <kbd>space</kbd>, <kbd>shift-space</kbd>.  
Half a page: <kbd>d</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>.

There are of course many more shortcuts! Press <kbd>?</kbd> to see them all.
That opens the keyboard shortcuts dialog, which helps you remember the
shortcuts, and lets you customize every single one of them. You can also look at
all default shortcuts [here][defaults].
