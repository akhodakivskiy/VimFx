VimFx is a Firefox extension which adds short, Vim-style keyboard shortcuts
for browsing and navigation, for a near mouseless experience.

- Doesn’t change your browser in any way. Everything can be disabled.
- Easy for beginners, powerful for advanced users. Not just for Vim fanatics.
- Modeled after [Vimium] for Chrome.

## Installation Instructions

Before installing VimFx, make sure LegacyFox is installed. On Linux, you can
issue the commands below; on other operating systems, you can copy the files
from the [LegacyFox repository] into your Firefox installation directory.

[LegacyFox repository]: https://git.gir.st/LegacyFox.git/tree

```
git clone https://git.gir.st/LegacyFox.git 
cd LegacyFox
sudo make install  # set DESTDIR= for custom install location
```
Get the latest release from [releases]: https://github.com/akhodakivskiy/VimFx/releases/
Download the xpi (right click -> save link as), and open the downloaded file in firefox. Don't click on the release itself, as you won't be able to install it that way.

## Why VimFx was created

> Even before [Vimium] there was [Vimperator] for Firefox. In my opinion,
> Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox
> appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added
> functionality, but for Chrome. That’s why I decided to develop a similar
> extension for Firefox.
>
> &nbsp;**VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.**

## Key Features

VimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply
invoke standard Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar
functionality.

Press <kbd>f</kbd> to mark links, text inputs and buttons on the page. Then
either type the [_hint_ or the _text_][hint-chars] of a marked element to click
it. This command has many variations, for example to copy links or open them in
new tabs.

Search with <kbd>/</kbd> and cycle between matches with <kbd>n</kbd> and
<kbd>N</kbd>.

Open a new tab with <kbd>t</kbd>, close it with <kbd>x</kbd>. Reopen it again
with <kbd>X</kbd>. Switch between tabs with <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>K</kbd>, or
some of the several other tab commands.

Scrolling left/down/up/right: <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>.  
Top/Bottom: <kbd>gg</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd>.  
Page up/down: <kbd>space</kbd>, <kbd>shift-space</kbd>.  
Half a page: <kbd>d</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd>.

Use [Caret mode] to copy text without using the mouse.

There are of course many more shortcuts! Press <kbd>?</kbd> to see them all, and
then <kbd>/</kbd> to search among them. Click on a command or open VimFx’s
[options] page in the Add-ons Manager to customize the [default shortcuts].

You can temporarily disable VimFx by using Ignore mode. Press <kbd>i</kbd> to
enter it, and <kbd>shift-escape</kbd> to exit. Use the [blacklist] to
automatically enter Ignore mode on specific sites.

There’s also an [article on ghacks.net][ghacks] which is a good introduction.
