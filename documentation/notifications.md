# Notifications

Some commands may show notifications, such as the `n` and `N` commands which
tell when they wrap around the page, or the phrase you searched for could not be
found.

VimFx’s notifications are similar to the “URL popup,” shown when hovering or
focusing links, but is placed on the opposite side.

Notifications are shown until you click them, press a key or switch tab.
