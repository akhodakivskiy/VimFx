# Tools

This section describes how to install and use the tools needed to:

- Build VimFx from source
- Lint code
- Sync locales
- Prepare releases


## Installation

1. Install [Node.js].

2. Run `npm install` to download dependencies and development dependencies.

3. Optional: Run `npm install --global gulp` to be able to run [`gulp`][gulp]
   from the terminal.

   If you prefer not to install `gulp` globally, you can use `npm run gulp`
   instead. For example, to create an .xpi file: `npm run gulp -- xpi`.

[gulp]: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp


## Getting started

### How to build and install the latest version from source

1. Follow the installation instructions above.

2. Run `npm run gulp -- xpi`.

3. [Open `build/VimFx.xpi` in Firefox][open-xpi].

Note that the built .xpi file is [unsigned].

[open-xpi]: installation.md#how-to-install-an-xpi-file-in-firefox
[unsigned]: installation.md#what-is-a-signed-add-on

### Development

1. Create a new [Firefox profile] for development.

2. Install the [Extension Auto-Installer] add-on in your development profile.

An easy workflow is code, `gulp`, test, repeat. (Use `gulp -t` to also run the
unit tests.)

## Gulp tasks

[gulp] is a task runner, which is used to automate most VimFx tasks.

The tasks are defined in [gulpfile.coffee]. They are summarized in the following
sub-sections.

(There are a few more tasks defined in [gulpfile.coffee], but they are only used
internally by other tasks.)

[gulpfile.coffee]: ../gulpfile.coffee

### Building

- `gulp build` creates the `build/` directory. It is basically a copy of the
  `extension/` directory, except some of the files have been compiled. For
  example, the .coffee files are compiled to .js.

- `gulp xpi` runs `gulp build` and then zips the `build/` directory into
  `build/VimFx.xpi` (an .xpi file is a renamed .zip file).

- `gulp push` (or just `gulp`) runs `gulp xpi` and then pushes `build/VimFx.xpi`
  to `http://localhost:8888`, which causes the [Extension Auto-Installer] to
  automatically install it. (No need to restart Firefox.)

- Use the `--test` or `-t` option to include the unit test files into the build.
  The output of the tests are `console.log`ed. Use the [browser console], or
  start Firefox from the terminal to see it.

- Use the `--unlisted` or `-u` option to append `-unlisted` to the extension ID.
  This is used when adding .xpi files to github releases.

- `gulp clean` removes the `build/` directory.

### Management

- `gulp lint` lints all .coffee files. There’s also `npm run addons-linter` to
  run [`addons-linter`] on a freshly built VimFx .xpi.

- `gulp sloc` prints comment and source code line counts.

- `gulp sync-locales` syncs locales. See the [“Syncing locales”][sync-locales]
  section below for more information.

[sync-locales]: #syncing-locales

### Helpers

- `gulp faster` compiles `gulpfile.coffee` to `gulpfile.js`. If you run `gulp` a
  lot and wish it ran faster, just tell it and it will! You’ll have to remember
  to re-run `gulp faster` whenever `gulpfile.coffee` is updated, though.

- `gulp help.html` dumps VimFx’s Keyboard Shortcuts help dialog into
  `help.html`. You can then open up `help.html` in Firefox and style it live
  using the Style Editor! You can even press the “Save” button when done to save
  your changes!

### Release

See the [“Making a release”][release] section below for more information.

- `gulp release` tags things with a new version number.

- `gulp changelog` prints changelog entries from `CHANGELOG.md` as HTML to
  stdout.

- `gulp readme` prints `README.md` as HTML to stdout.

Tip: Add `--silent` at the end of the gulp command to suppress gulp’s standard
progress output. This allows to pipe stdout to the clipboard, without getting
unwanted cruft around the output.

## Syncing locales

This is usually not done by translators, but by developers who change, add or
remove features that involves localized text.

If you add, remove or reorder translations in a file, do so in _one_ of the
locales (one that is easy for you to test—but always write new translations in
English!). If you modified the en-US locale, run `gulp sync-locales --en-US` (or
just `gulp sync-locales`). Substitute “en-US” with a locale of choice if needed.
That rewrites all other locales so that:

- Old translations are removed.
- New translations are added (in English).
- All translations appear in the same order.

If you modify an existing translation in a file and want to update all other
locales to use the new wording, add `UPDATE_ALL` at the end of it. `gulp
sync-locales` will then use that translation in _all_ locales, replacing what
was there before. It also removes `UPDATE_ALL` for you. However, if possible,
edit all other locales by hand to save as much translated text as possible.

Note that `gulp sync-locales` requires every translation to be in a single line.
In other words, do not line-wrap translations. Also don’t bother adding comments
when translating locale files, since they will be removed by `gulp
sync-locales`.

If you run `gulp sync-locales` with “en-US” as the base locale, a report is
printed telling how complete all other locales are. Add `--sv-SE?` (note the
question mark) to restrict the report to the “sv-SE” locale (you can of course
substitute with any other locale). In that case, every line (including line
number) that don’t differ compared to “en-US” is also be printed.


## Making a release

Before making a release, it might be wise to:

- Run `npm update` and/or `npm outdated` to see if there are any updates to
  dependencies. Investigate what’s new and test!
- Run `gulp sync-locales` to make sure that no translation has been left behind.
- Run `gulp lint` and `npm run addons-linter` to catch potential problems.
- Run `gulp --test` to make sure the tests pass.
- Inspect the `build/` directory to see that nothing strange has been included
  or generated by `gulp build`.

Steps:

1. Add a list of changes since the last version at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.

2. Update the version in `package.json` ([versioning guidelines]), the minimum
   Firefox version (if needed) and the maximum Firefox version (ideally to the
   latest nightly). See [valid Firefox versions].

3. Run `gulp release`, which does the following for you:

  - Adds a heading with the new version number and today’s date at the top of
    `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - Commits `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`.
  - Tags the commit.

4. Run `gulp xpi` to rebuild with the new version number.

5. Try the just build version, just to be sure.

6. Publish on addons.mozilla.org. Add the release notes list as HTML. `gulp
   changelog` prints the latest changelog entry as HTML. `gulp changelog -2`
   prints the latest two (etc). The latter is useful if publishing a new version
   before the last published version had been reviewed; then the new version
   should contain both changelog entries.

7. Push to github. Don’t forget to push the tag! (It’s better to do this after
   the publish on addons.mozilla.org, because sometimes its validator complains.
   This saves some commits.)

8. Make a “release” out of the new tag on github, and attach an .xpi to it:

   1. Create the .xpi by running `gulp xpi --unlisted`.
   2. Sign it on AMO.
   3. Attach to the release.

The idea is to use the contents of `README.md` as the add-on description on
addons.mozilla.org. You can print it as HTML by running `gulp readme`.
